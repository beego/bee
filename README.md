[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/beego/bee.svg?branch=develop&label=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/beego/bee)

## Requirements

- Go version >= 1.13

## Installation

To install `bee` use the `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/beego/bee/v2
```

Then you can add `bee` binary to PATH environment variable in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:<your_main_gopath>/bin
```

> If you already have `bee` installed, updating `bee` is simple:

```bash
go get -u github.com/beego/bee/v2
```

## Basic commands

Bee provides a variety of commands which can be helpful at various stages of development. The top level commands include:

```
    version     Prints the current Bee version
    migrate     Runs database migrations
    api         Creates a Beego API application
    bale        Transforms non-Go files to Go source files
    fix         Fixes your application by making it compatible with newer versions of Beego
    pro         Source code generator
    dlv         Start a debugging session using Delve
    dockerize   Generates a Dockerfile for your Beego application
    generate    Source code generator
    hprose      Creates an RPC application based on Hprose and Beego frameworks
    new         Creates a Beego application
    pack        Compresses a Beego application into a single file
    rs          Run customized scripts
    run         Run the application by starting a local development server
    server      serving static content over HTTP on port
    update      Update Bee
```

### bee version

To display the current version of `bee`, `beego` and `go` installed on your machine:

```bash
$ bee version
______
| ___ \
| |_/ /  ___   ___
| ___ \ / _ \ / _ \
| |_/ /|  __/|  __/
\____/  \___| \___| v2.0.4

├── Beego     : 2.0.4
├── GoVersion : go1.14.1
├── GOOS      : darwin
├── GOARCH    : amd64
├── NumCPU    : 4
├── GOPATH    : /home/beeuser/.go
├── GOROOT    : /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.14.1/libexec
├── Compiler  : gc
└── Published : 2020-09-13
```

You can also change the output format using `-o` flag:

```bash
$ bee version -o json
{
    "GoVersion": "go1.14.1",
    "GOOS": "darwin",
    "GOARCH": "amd64",
    "NumCPU": 4,
    "GOPATH": "/home/beeuser/.go",
    "GOROOT": "/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.14.1/libexec",
    "Compiler": "gc",
    "BeeVersion": "2.0.4",
    "BeegoVersion": "2.0.4",

#### 
## Shortcuts

Because you'll likely type these generator commands over and over, it makes sense to create aliases:

```bash
# Generator Stuff
alias g:a="bee generate appcode"
alias g:m="bee generate model"
alias g:c="bee generate controller"
alias g:v="bee generate view"
alias g:mi="bee generate migration"
```

These can be stored , for example, in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` files.

## Help

To print more information on the usage of a particular command, use `bee help <command>`.

For instance, to get more information about the `run` command:

```bash
$ bee help run
USAGE
  bee run [appname] [watchall] [-main=*.go] [-downdoc=true]  [-gendoc=true] [-vendor=true] [-e=folderToExclude]  [-tags=goBuildTags] [-runmode=BEEGO_RUNMODE]

  -main=[]
      Specify main go files.

```

## Contributing
Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are always welcome.

We work on two branches: `master` for stable, released code and `develop`, a development branch.
It might be important to distinguish them when you are reading the commit history searching for a feature or a bugfix,
or when you are unsure of where to base your work from when contributing.

### Found a bug?

Please [submit an issue][new-issue] on GitHub and we will follow up.
Even better, we would appreciate a [Pull Request][new-pr] with a fix for it!

- If the bug was found in a release, it is best to base your work on `master` and submit your PR against it.
- If the bug was found on `develop` (the development branch), base your work on `develop` and submit your PR against it.

Please follow the [Pull Request Guidelines][new-pr].

### Want a feature?

Feel free to request a feature by [submitting an issue][new-issue] on GitHub and open the discussion.

If you'd like to implement a new feature, please consider opening an issue first to talk about it.
It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should be aware of
before implementing the change. If you are about to open a Pull Request, please make sure to follow the [submissions guidelines][new-pr].

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe you will find that a similar one already exists.

If you are submitting an issue for a bug, please include the following:

- An overview of the issue
- Your use case (why is this a bug for you?)
- The version of `bee` you are running (include the output of `bee version`)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Eventually, logs from your application.
- Ideally, a suggested fix

The more information you give us, the more able to help we will be!

### Submitting a Pull Request

- First of all, make sure to base your work on the `develop` branch (the development branch):

```
  # a bugfix branch for develop would be prefixed by fix/
  # a bugfix branch for master would be prefixed by hotfix/
  $ git checkout -b feature/my-feature develop
```

- Please create commits containing **related changes**. For example, two different bugfixes should produce two separate commits.
A feature should be made of commits splitted by **logical chunks** (no half-done changes). Use your best judgement as to
how many commits your changes require.

- Write insightful and descriptive commit messages. It lets us and future contributors quickly understand your changes
without having to read your changes. Please provide a summary in the first line (50-72 characters) and eventually,
go to greater lengths in your message's body. A good example can be found in [Angular commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format).

- Please **include the appropriate test cases** for your patch.

- Make sure all tests pass before submitting your changes.

- Rebase your commits. It may be that new commits have been introduced on `develop`.
Rebasing will update your branch with the most recent code and make your changes easier to review:

  ```
  $ git fetch
  $ git rebase origin/develop
  ```

- Push your changes:

  ```
  $ git push origin -u feature/my-feature
  ```

- Open a pull request against the `develop` branch.

- If we suggest changes:
  - Please make the required updates (after discussion if any)
  - Only create new commits if it makes sense. Generally, you will want to amend your latest commit or rebase your branch after the new changes:

    ```
    $ git rebase -i develop
    # choose which commits to edit and perform the updates
    ```

  - Re-run the tests
  - Force push to your branch:

    ```
    $ git push origin feature/my-feature -f
    ```
